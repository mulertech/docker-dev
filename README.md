The **MulerTech Docker-dev** package provides complete Docker-based development environments for web projects with multiple templates (Apache, MySQL, Symfony) and includes integrated testing capabilities.

## Description

This package simplifies web development by providing pre-configured Docker environments for different project types. It offers ready-to-use templates for various development stacks and includes integrated testing tools (PHPUnit, PHPStan, PHP-CS-Fixer) that work seamlessly within the containerized environment.

## Prerequisites

### For PHP Projects
- Docker
- PHP
- Composer

### For Static HTML/CSS/JS Projects
- Docker only

## Installation

### For PHP Projects (Symfony, Apache-MySQL, Apache-Simple)

1. Include the package as a dev dependency with Composer :

    ```sh
    composer require-dev mulertech/docker-dev
    ```

2. Run the following command to install the package :

    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

### For Static HTML/CSS/JS Projects (Apache-HTML)

Since this template doesn't use PHP or Composer, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Quick Setup with Install Script (Recommended)

```sh
# Download and run the installation script in the project directory
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mulertech/docker-dev/main/install-apache-html.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Download all necessary Docker files
- Auto-configure environment variables (USER_ID, GROUP_ID, unique ports)
- Create a sample `index.html` file (if none exists)
- Provide ready-to-use Docker environment

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Download the apache-html template files from [GitHub](https://github.com/mulertech/docker-dev/tree/main/templates/apache-html)
2. Copy the files to your project root:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `compose.yml` 
   - `.env.example` (rename to `.env`)
3. Run the Docker environment:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

### Development Environment Templates

The primary feature of this package is to quickly set up complete development environments. Initialize your project with:

```sh
# Auto-detect and initialize the best template for your project
./vendor/bin/mtdocker init

# Or choose a specific template
./vendor/bin/mtdocker init symfony
./vendor/bin/mtdocker init apache-mysql  
./vendor/bin/mtdocker init apache-simple
./vendor/bin/mtdocker init apache-html
```

This creates a complete development environment with web server, database (if needed), and all necessary services ready to use.

**ðŸš€ Zero-Configuration Mode:**
You can also just run any command directly and the environment will be auto-initialized:

```sh
# These commands automatically set up your environment if needed
./vendor/bin/mtdocker up -d
./vendor/bin/mtdocker test
./vendor/bin/mtdocker down
```

No manual setup required - the system detects your project type and creates the appropriate environment automatically.

### Managing Your Development Environment

```sh
# Start your development environment
./vendor/bin/mtdocker up -d

# Stop your environment
./vendor/bin/mtdocker down

# Check environment status
./vendor/bin/mtdocker ps
```

### Testing and Code Quality Tools

Integrated testing tools work seamlessly within your development environment:

#### Running the tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker test
```

To run the tests with code coverage, use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker test-coverage
```
The code coverage report will be generated in the `./.phpunit.cache/coverage` folder.

These commands will:
- Check if the Docker container is running.
- If the container is not running, it will be started.
- Run the PHPUnit tests in the container.
- Stop the container if it was not running before the tests were executed.

### Running phpstan

To run phpstan, use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker phpstan
```

This command will:
- Check if the Docker container is running.
- If the container is not running, it will be started.
- Run phpstan in the container.
- Stop the container if it was not running before phpstan was executed.

### Running php-cs-fixer

To run php-cs-fixer, use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker php-cs-fixer
```

This command will:
- Check if the Docker container is running.
- If the container is not running, it will be started.
- Run php-cs-fixer in the container.
- Stop the container if it was not running before php-cs-fixer was executed.

### Symfony Console Commands (Symfony projects only)

For Symfony projects, you can run console commands directly in the container:

```sh
# Create a new entity
./vendor/bin/mtdocker symfony make:entity MyEntity

# Run database migrations
./vendor/bin/mtdocker symfony doctrine:migrations:migrate

# Clear cache
./vendor/bin/mtdocker symfony cache:clear

# Any other Symfony console command
./vendor/bin/mtdocker symfony [command] [arguments...]
```

This command will:
- Check that your project is a Symfony project.
- Check if the Docker container is running.
- If the container is not running, it will be started.
- Run `php bin/console [command]` in the container with all provided arguments.
- Stop the container if it was not running before the command was executed.

### Running php-cs-fixer, phpunit and phpstan

To run php-cs-fixer, phpunit and phpstan, use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker all
```

This command will:
- Check if the Docker container is running.
- If the container is not running, it will be started.
- Run php-cs-fixer, phpunit and phpstan in the container.
- Stop the container if it was not running before the checks were executed.

### Advanced Configuration

#### Getting the project name

To get the project name used for Docker Compose (useful for PHPStorm configuration), use the following command:

```sh
./vendor/bin/mtdocker name
```

This command will output the project name that should be used in the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable when configuring PHPStorm.

### Available Templates

**Smart template auto-detection:**
1. **Symfony projects** â†’ `symfony` template (detects `symfony/framework-bundle`, `symfony/symfony`, or `symfony/kernel`)
2. **Database projects** â†’ `apache-mysql` template (detects `ext-pdo` requirement) 
3. **Simple projects** â†’ `apache-simple` template (fallback)

**Available templates:**
- `apache-simple`: Basic Apache + PHP environment for simple web projects
- `apache-mysql`: Apache + PHP + MySQL environment for database-driven applications
- `apache-html`: Pure Apache HTTP server for static HTML/CSS/JS projects (no PHP) - [Download template files](https://github.com/mulertech/docker-dev/tree/main/templates/apache-html)
- `symfony`: Complete Symfony development environment with Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, Redis, and MailHog (automatically configures Doctrine for Docker environment)

**Template initialization process:**
- Creates a `.mtdocker/` directory in your project root
- Copies all necessary Docker configuration files
- Creates a `.env` file with auto-detected system settings (USER_ID, GROUP_ID, PHP version)
- Generates deterministic ports based on project name to avoid conflicts
- **Automatically adds `.mtdocker/` to `.gitignore`** (best practice)
- Provides a complete development environment ready to use

### Database Initialization

For templates with MySQL (`apache-mysql` and `symfony`), you can easily initialize your database with custom SQL files:

```sh
# 1. Copy your SQL files to the sql directory
cp my-backup.sql .mtdocker/sql/02-my-data.sql
cp schema.sql .mtdocker/sql/01-schema.sql

# 2. Restart the environment to apply changes
./vendor/bin/mtdocker down
./vendor/bin/mtdocker up -d
```

**File execution order:**
- `01-init-user.sql` (system - creates user with network permissions)
- Your SQL files in alphabetical order (e.g., `01-schema.sql`, `02-data.sql`)
- Supports `.sql`, `.sql.gz`, and `.sh` files

## IDE Integration

### PHPStorm Configuration

Configure PHPStorm to work with your Docker development environment:

**PHP Interpreter Setup:**
1. Open PHPStorm settings â†’ `PHP`
2. Click `...` next to `CLI Interpreter` field
3. Add new interpreter: `From Docker, Vagrant, VM, WSL, Remote...`
4. Configure Docker Compose interpreter:
   - Server: `Docker` (create new if needed)
   - Configuration files: `./.mtdocker/compose.yml`
   - Service: `apache` or `php`
   - Environment variables: `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<project name>` (get with `./vendor/bin/mtdocker name`)

**PHPUnit Integration:**
1. Go to `PHP` â†’ `Test Frameworks`
2. Add `PHPUnit by Remote Interpreter`
3. Select your Docker interpreter
4. Path to script: `/var/www/html/vendor/autoload.php`
5. Default configuration file: `/var/www/html/phpunit.xml.dist` (needed for Symfony projects)

## How It Works

**Intelligent Environment Setup:**
- When you run any command, the system automatically detects if a development environment exists
- If no `.mtdocker/` directory is found, it auto-initializes the most appropriate template
- Smart detection analyzes your `composer.json` to choose the perfect environment:
  - **Symfony projects**: Full Symfony stack with Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, Redis, MailHog
  - **Database projects**: Apache + PHP + MySQL when `ext-pdo` is detected
  - **Simple projects**: Basic Apache + PHP environment

**Template Features:**
- Pre-configured Docker environments for different project types
- Auto-detected system settings (USER_ID, GROUP_ID, PHP version)
- Deterministic port generation to avoid conflicts between projects
- Complete development stacks ready to use immediately

**Smart Defaults:**
- PHP version auto-detected from `composer.json`
- Database services included when needed
- Unique container names and ports per project
- No manual configuration required

**Container Naming:**
- **Apache containers**: `docker-<project-name>-<php-version>` (e.g., `docker-myapp-8-4`)
- **Other services**: `<project-name>-<service>` (e.g., `myapp-mysql`, `myapp-redis`)
- **Project name**: Used for Docker Compose isolation between projects

**Automatic Git Integration:**
- `.mtdocker/` directory is automatically added to `.gitignore`
- Each developer gets their own local environment configuration
- No conflicts between team members' development setups
